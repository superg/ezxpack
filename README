Utility for repacking resource archives, used in Motorola EZX smartphones.
There is perl script somewhere on the net for this, but it produces invalid archives.

Compilation:
You'll need CMake build system, boost-filesystem and boost-program-options libraries for utility
(for example cmake, libboost-filesystem, libboost-program-options packages in Ubuntu).
Open terminal and go to directory with this README, and run following commands:
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
make install # either as root, or "sudo make install" in Ubuntu

Usage:
ezxpack -o resources iconres.ezx - extract "iconres.ezx" to "resources" directory
ezxpack -p -o iconres.ezx resources - pack "resources" directory to "iconres.ezx"

Uninstallation:
You may uninstall ezxpack from system (like any other software, built with cmake) by running
command "xargs rm < install_manifest.txt" from build directory.

This utility was written a while ago, compilation was tested only on Ubuntu 10.10, so if have
some problems - let me know.
